An app that is capable of spliting large files into smaller ones and uploading the chunks onto different cloud providers (Google Drive, Onedrive, Dropbox) using their api's. The app is made mostly in Nodejs and doesn't use any major framework or library. 

Coding like it's 1975. Result of 17 hours of coding non-stop with 2 other colleagues.
Was responsible for the general framework, API integration, etc.


It uses webassembly for the file splitting. The code for webassembly was written in plain C.
